This is a part of my personal portfolio.

In this project I trasnform a design mockup file into a HTML site following the basics steps, as adviced on "Introdução ao HTML e CSS" Udacity course: 

1. Identify the various boxes you will need to build in order to recreate the design.
2. Write your HTML and CSS files, continue to iterate until your work is representative of the design mockup.
3. Validate your HTML and CSS against the W3C's Validators.
